\arguments{
\item{y}{A response vector for uncensored data, a two column matrix for
binomial data or censored data, with the second column being the censoring
indicator (1: uncensored, 0: right censored, -1: left censored), or an
object of class, \code{response} (created by
\code{\link[rmutil]{restovec}}) or \code{repeated} (created by
\code{\link[rmutil]{rmna}}) or \code{\link[rmutil]{lvna}}). If the
\code{repeated} data object contains more than one response variable, give
that object in \code{envir} and give the name of the response variable to
be used here.}

\item{distribution}{Either a character string containing the name of the
distribution or a function giving the -log likelihood and calling the
location, shape, and family functions. Distributions are Box-Cox
transformed normal, generalized inverse Gauss, generalized logistic,
Hjorth, generalized gamma, Burr, generalized Weibull, power exponential,
Student t, generalized extreme value, power variance function Poisson, and
skew Laplace. (For definitions of distributions, see the corresponding
[dpqr]distribution help.)}

\item{mu}{A user-specified function of \code{pmu}, and possibly
\code{linear}, giving the regression equation for the location. This may
contain a linear part as the second argument to the function. It may also
be a formula beginning with ~, specifying a either linear regression
function for the location parameter in the Wilkinson and Rogers notation or
a general function with named unknown parameters. If it contains unknown
parameters, the keyword \code{linear} may be used to specify a linear part.
If nothing is supplied, the location is taken to be constant unless the
linear argument is given.}

\item{shape}{A user-specified function of \code{pshape}, and possibly
\code{linear} and/or \code{mu}, giving the regression equation for the
dispersion or shape parameter. This may contain a linear part as the second
argument to the function and the location function as last argument (in
which case \code{shfn} must be set to TRUE). It may also be a formula
beginning with ~, specifying either a linear regression function for the
shape parameter in the Wilkinson and Rogers notation or a general function
with named unknown parameters. If it contains unknown parameters, the
keyword \code{linear} may be used to specify a linear part and the keyword
\code{mu} to specify a function of the location parameter. If nothing is
supplied, this parameter is taken to be constant unless the linear argument
is given. This parameter is the logarithm of the usual one.}

\item{nest}{The variable classifying observations by the unit upon which
they were observed. Ignored if \code{y} or \code{envir} has class,
response.}

\item{family}{A user-specified function of \code{pfamily}, and possibly
\code{linear}, for the regression equation of the third (family) parameter
of the distribution. This may contain a linear part that is the second
argument to the function. It may also be a formula beginning with ~,
specifying either a linear regression function for the family parameter in
the Wilkinson and Rogers notation or a general function with named unknown
parameters. If neither is supplied, this parameter is taken to be constant
unless the linear argument is given. In most cases, this parameter is the
logarithm of the usual one.}

\item{linear}{A formula beginning with ~ in W&R notation, specifying the
linear part of the regression function for the location parameter or list
of two such expressions for the location and/or shape parameters.}

\item{pmu}{Vector of initial estimates for the location parameters. If
\code{mu} is a formula with unknown parameters, their estimates must be
supplied either in their order of appearance in the expression or in a
named list.}

\item{pshape}{Vector of initial estimates for the shape parameters. If
\code{shape} is a formula with unknown parameters, their estimates must be
supplied either in their order of appearance in the expression or in a
named list.}

\item{pfamily}{Vector of initial estimates for the family parameters. If
\code{family} is a formula with unknown parameters, their estimates must be
supplied either in their order of appearance in the expression or in a
named list.}

\item{psd}{Initial estimate of the standard deviation of the normal mixing
distribution.}

\item{exact}{If TRUE, fits the exact likelihood function for continuous
data by integration over intervals of observation, i.e. interval censoring.}

\item{wt}{Weight vector.}

\item{scale}{The scale on which the random effect is applied:
\code{identity}, \code{log}, \code{logit}, \code{reciprocal}, or
\code{exp}.}

\item{points}{The number of points for Gauss-Hermite integration of the
random effect.}

\item{common}{If TRUE, at least two of \code{mu}, \code{shape}, and
\code{family} must both be either functions with, as argument, a vector of
parameters having some or all elements in common between them so that
indexing is in common between them or formulae with unknowns. All parameter
estimates must be supplied in \code{pmu}. If FALSE, parameters are distinct
between the two functions and indexing starts at one in each function.}

\item{delta}{Scalar or vector giving the unit of measurement (always one
for discrete data) for each response value, set to unity by default.
Ignored if y has class, response. For example, if a response is measured to
two decimals, \code{delta=0.01}. If the response is transformed, this must
be multiplied by the Jacobian. The transformation cannot contain unknown
parameters. For example, with a log transformation, \code{delta=1/y}. (The
delta values for the censored response are ignored.)}

\item{envir}{Environment in which model formulae are to be interpreted or a
data object of class, \code{repeated}, \code{tccov}, or \code{tvcov}; the
name of the response variable should be given in \code{y}. If \code{y} has
class \code{repeated}, it is used as the environment.}

\item{print.level}{Arguments for nlm.}

\item{typsize}{Arguments for nlm.}

\item{ndigit}{Arguments for nlm.}

\item{gradtol}{Arguments for nlm.}

\item{stepmax}{Arguments for nlm.}

\item{steptol}{Arguments for nlm.}

\item{iterlim}{Arguments for nlm.}

\item{fscale}{Arguments for nlm.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{gnlm} is returned that contains all of the
relevant information calculated, including error codes.
}
\description{
\code{gnlmm3} fits user-specified nonlinear regression equations to one or
more parameters of the common three parameter distributions. The intercept
of the location regression has a normally-distributed random effect. This
normal mixing distribution is computed by Gauss-Hermite integration.
}
\details{
The \code{scale} of the random effect is the link function to be applied.
For example, if it is \code{log}, the supplied mean function, \code{mu}, is
transformed as exp(log(mu)+sd), where sd is the random effect parameter.

It is recommended that initial estimates for \code{pmu}, \code{pshape}, and
\code{pfamily} be obtained from \code{gnlr3}.

Nonlinear regression models can be supplied as formulae where parameters
are unknowns in which case factor variables cannot be used and parameters
must be scalars. (See \code{\link[rmutil]{finterp}}.)

The printed output includes the -log likelihood (not the deviance), the
corresponding AIC, the maximum likelihood estimates, standard errors, and
correlations.
